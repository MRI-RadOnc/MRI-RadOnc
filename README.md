# Research Group Artificial Intelligence and Radiomics

Our research group focuses on the integration of  artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in oncology. By leveraging both machine learning and state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), we aim to enhance the management of complex clinical data, facilitate more informed treatment decisions, and support medical professionals in refining patient care strategies. In addition, our work includes the automated analysis of medical imaging dataâ€”such as CT, MRI, and PETâ€”to non-invasively characterize biological tissues and reveal critical insights into tumor behavior. Through radiomics, neural networks, and transformer-based LLMs, we develop models that improve prognosis prediction, therapy response assessment, and the determination of non-invasive molecular-pathological characteristics, ultimately driving precision medicine in oncology. We also seek to elucidate the added value of AI methodologies for therapy planning and patient-specific treatment adaptation.

### Research Focus
